                <h2>Hunter Thoma</h2>
                <p>hunter decided it would be a good idea to talk to children in a vr game and get them to add him,
         usually that would be ok because alot of adults ranging 18 - 50 play vrchat and some of them ( 18 - 25 ) have friends that are maybe ( 16 - 30 )
         which i get that but i dont get why a 18 year old would think its anywhere near a good idea to add a 10 y/o , 12 y/o , 13 y/o , and a 14 y/o. just to promote vaping and other harmful stuff to the 10 y/o and asking a 13 y/o to date him ( after he dated a 16 y/o ) - he also promoted porn and said sexual stuff to these minors ( illegal in the U.S.A to provide minors with pornography, and also illegal to say sexual things to minors - pedophilia - ) he made his ex ( 16 ) cry alot said sexual stuff to her and promoted harm to her like it was ok.</p>
